# Frogger Game Project

This repository contains an old school project where we programmed a version of the classic game Frogger using the Processing programming language.

## About the Project

This project was part of our school assignment to demonstrate our understanding of game development concepts using Processing. Frogger is a classic arcade game where the player navigates a frog across a busy road and river, avoiding obstacles and reaching the safe zone.

## Features

- Player-controlled frog movement.
- Vehicle and obstacle movement with collision detection.
- River with moving logs and turtles.
- Safe zones and scoring mechanism.

## Requirements

- Processing IDE installed.
- Basic understanding of Java programming language.
- Familiarity with game development concepts such as collision detection and sprite animation.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in the Processing IDE.
3. Run the sketch to start the game.
4. Use arrow keys to move the frog up, down, left, and right.
5. Avoid collisions with vehicles and obstacles.
6. Reach the safe zones to earn points.
